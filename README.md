# Scrabble

In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.

A - 1
B - 3
C - 3
D - 2
E - 1
F - 4
G - 2
H - 4
I - 1
J - 8
K - 5
L - 1
M - 3
N - 1
O - 1
P - 3 
Q - 10
R - 1
S - 1
T - 1
U - 1
V - 4
W - 4
X - 8 
Y - 4
Z - 10
For example, if we wanted to score the word Code, we would note that in general Scrabble rules, the C is worth 3 points, the o is worth 1 point, the d is worth 2 points, and the e is worth 1 point. Summing these, we get that Code is worth 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 points.
